# HUBusca
An online platform that leverages the public GitHub API to streamline the search for users and their repositories.
When looking for a user, you'll see their information right on the initial screen. To view more details, just click on their profile photo to navigate to the second screen. On this screen, you'll find the user's profile picture along with a list of all their public repositories. If you select a repository, you'll be taken to that project's GitHub page. Additionally, there's a "History" option in the menu that allows you to check the list of previously searched users and delete any you no longer need.
